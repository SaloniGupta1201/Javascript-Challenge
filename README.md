## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
## Background
This respository displayed the eye-witness reports, and the collected data that shows the extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth. All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

A Dynamic javascript and DOM manipulation was created to integrate various javascript libraries provide from D3 to moments, and pulled in data from a filtered javascript object, and populated to a table. Users can also filter the table data for specific values. Technologies used were JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js to deploy the data on the web page.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
- A basic HTML web page was created.
- All the UFO dataset JavaScript objects were appended to a table in to the web page, and then a new rows added for each UFO sighting.
- Finally date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment columns was created.
- On this part we displayed a form with a filtering option that uses the date/time column to find rows that match user input. </br>

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
- Level two satisfies all the criterias of Level 1, but it added a multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, so that the users can set a multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  - date/time
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape
